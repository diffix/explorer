## What it does

Anonymized data from the Diffix-protected datasets is inherently restricted. The analyst needs to be familiar with the imposed limitations, and knowledgeable of possible workarounds. The aim of this project is to build a system that automatically extracts a high-level picture of the shape of a given data set whilst intelligently navigating the restrictions imposed by Diffix.

## Getting started

### Prerequisites

Things that one needs to have installed to develop the system.
We should avoid dependencies that need to be manually installed as much as possible.
If we have databases or other such dependencies there should be scripts that allows someone to get up a sensible development environment with a single click or command.

### Running

Describe the commands needed to get the system running
