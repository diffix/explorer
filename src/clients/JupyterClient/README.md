# Python Client and Analysis Tools for Diffix Explorer

This is a collection of tools that can be used to extract data from the [Diffix Explorer API](https://github.com/diffix/explorer) for debugging or for further analysis.

## Install

Using [Python Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/docs/) you can install the dependencies and create a virtual environment with just one command:
```
poetry install
```

You will also need a local instance of the Diffix Explorer API (or access to a remote instance). [Diffix Explorer API](https://github.com/diffix/explorer)
